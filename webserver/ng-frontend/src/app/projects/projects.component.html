  name="Transformer-based Code Autocomplete"
  description="Write some code in Java, and let a machine learning model guess what comes next!
               Trained on 1.8 million snippets of code, this model uses the Universal Transformer architecture,
               which repeatedly applies the same Transformer block to iteratively refine context.">

  name="Automated Code Retrieval and Summarization"
  description="Need a better way to search for code snippets?
               Perplexed by some poorly documented legacy implementation?
               The BVAE is a framework that tries to solve the problems of code retrieval and summarization.
               This project was my senior comps at Carleton, for which I earned distinction."
